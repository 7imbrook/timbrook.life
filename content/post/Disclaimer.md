You might notice that there’s nothing really on this webpage… that’s because timbrook.life isn’t the hip new start up on the block. It’s just a place for me to play around with new technologies (and old ones) to learn and put together boilerplate infrastructure. New hip startups you’re more then welcome to credit me with your success.

Some of the technologies that I’ll be blogging about here and that are currently powering this site include Terraform, Docker, Rexray and Traefik. The page is “hacked” together with React and Hugo. And monitoring is done with Prometheus, cadvisor and graphana.

All of this site is open source on my [GitHub](https://github.com/7imbrook/timbrook.life). Documentation is *forming* to say the least.
